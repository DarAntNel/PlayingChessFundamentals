PlayingChessFundamentals


In this project we make use of the python-chess project to simulate
chess gameplay using our newly implemented search and decision making algorithms
gameplay is done running "python gameplay.py"
Directories containing our code include:
LLM, MiniMax, Expectimax, Alphabeta, Evaluation.
Stockfish engine is located in folder stockfish.
Please note when running the gameplay.py, you will need to add a .env file to this project in your local repository containing an API key to groc.
The .pgn files in the root directory contains the history of some games played from the gameplay.py.
You should be able to copy games into online engines and see moves played.
